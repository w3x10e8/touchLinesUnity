# touchLinesUnity
A simple script to draw straight lines with touch or mouse pointer for Unity3D. The lines have a collider attached to them and are stored in a list. Collider is spawned only when the line is completely drawn. There is a minimum length of the line which helps distinguishing between tapping and dragging. Lines are drawn only when the length of drag is greater than the minimum length.

## Todo
Optimize the code.

## Applications
Can be modified to make games like golf,angry birds etc.
